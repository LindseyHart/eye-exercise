<img src= "oneeye.png" width='300'/>
<h3>Desciption</h3>
<p>This project was about making 2 eyes on the screen follow the computer mouse where ever it went. It has a background and part of the eye disappears behind the outline if you put your mouse far enough away.</p>
<h3>How to Run</h3>
<p>To run this project please go to this url:https://lindseyhart.github.io/eye-exercise/</p>
<h3>Roadmap of Future Improvements</h3>
<p>For this project I would love to change the eye color in the future. Maybe have the eye color change after a few seconds and rotate through a set list of colors.</p>
